>*Reda*, thank you for being the person that the students could rely on in their most important times in their education.

I will always remember you as a trustworthy, creative, pedagogical but first and foremost truly kind friend. 
I would love for you to come back next year again and kick ass. 

P.S. I owe you a big üç∫

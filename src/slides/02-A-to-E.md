>*Reda*, I appreciate how you helped me in my moment of crisis when suffocating from anxiety, not knowing what the hell I was doing with the Terminal. In a crowded class you took the time to make sure I was up to date.  
For this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You'll be pleased to know I now use Terminal on a regular basis. I wouldn't say Terminal and I are friends yet but definitely heading in the right direction! Feel safe knowing every time I look at the terminal I think of you hahahah! Thank you for all your support and advice and support!

>Hi *Reda*!  
I think you are the best in the role of our industry leader who basically introduced us and led us into Front-End world. I, and probably everyone else really appreciate you for being very understanding and supportive all along through our wins and struggles during this journey.  
<br>
These 2 modules were crucial, and certainly a struggle as for someone who just started, but atmosphere you've created as our leader was just best. We all really appreciate you, and I hope and wish you could stay here, guiding us for the rest of our journey as you did really great job in this role 😊

> *Reda*, thank you for making difficult subjects so entertaining! And for being a great friend. Gonna miss that moustache on Zoom. Might take a screenshot and put your picture next to every Zoom meeting in the future just to cure my abstinence. 😉 🤗

>*Reda*, the coolest guy on the block!   
I don’t think I’ve ever had a lecturer that motivated me so much in learning more and more. You’ve made me more confident in coding and been a great inspiration during these last months.

>Hey *Reda*! ✨   
First of all, I just want to say how amazing was to have you as our first industry leader. Starting to code from scratch with a totally different background was something that made me afraid of doing it. In the back of my mind, my fear was always to not be able to keep up. But with your support, always very attentive to all levels and different contexts that the class has, I was able to unleash the developer inside of me and surprise myself with my potential in the best possible way!   
<br>
And for that, I will always appreciate you. Thanks for all the knowledge and the friendship. You’re the best ✨🌟

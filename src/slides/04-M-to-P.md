*Reda*, thanks for always supporting us, listening to our errors and debugging with us even during all the days we felt like this guy:

>*Reda*,  
For these first modules, you were more vital than the <code>MDN Web Docs</code> to kick-start our new journey, more crucial than <code>npmjs</code> to enhance our code, better than <code>Stack Overflow</code> to be as our guardian angel and soothe our anxieties, and much more important than <code>Udemy</code>, <code>freeCodeCamp</code>, <code>Codecademy</code>, and etc., combined.  
Thank you for being an amazing mentor, a source of inspiration, and a good friend!

Good luck with everything!

> I've been enjoying all your lectures since day one, *Reda* (that's something valuable coming from a real tech dummie as me). I also enjoyed your closeness and friendship attitude. I hope I can catch up on all the terminology to chat about nerd staff with you in the future. 

Thank you *Reda*!!

>*Reda*,   
Thank you for being a great role model and teacher, and an even better friend. I really appreciate the time you have taken to get to know us and spend the time with us. I feel inspired and motivated by you every time we get to hang out and after every lecture. I hope we can continue to talk after this module and long into the future.

>🚀 I have really enjoyed that you have been more than a teacher with us, you are also our friend, which is a rare achievement.  
🚀 You laid back and humorous attitude is why I have looked forward to each lecture.  
🚀 You are very smart, honest and curious. Best mentor/friend one could wish for.  
Keep being awesome, don't forget us because we sure won't forget you, give me a job in the future please, don't shave that mustache
